                Dear [CLIENT FIRST NAME],
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to discuss your vision for [PROJECT NAME] and considering [OUR COMPANY NAME] as your web design partner for this project. We look forward to helping your company grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our proposals we try to ensure that we address each of your needs with a clear and realistic solution. From our discussions, these are the key objectives that seem to have emerged and are the most important to solve:

                OUR PROCESS
            </h2>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            PLANNING
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <p>
                                Your project\'s success depends on a solid foundation determined by a research and discovery process.  This allows us to work efficiently and ensure that our developers have the information they need upfront to build your vision.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Without this discovery process the project will be plagued by ambiguity, confusion, assumptions and miscommunication ultimately leading to scope creep and the inability to deliver a product that we are happy with or more importantly that you will be happy with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During this phase our objective is to learn about your business goals, marketing objectives, industry, competitors and marketplace.  About who you are, where you\'ve been and where you want to go.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also dive into what the budget is, how you intend to deliver assets and page copy or if we need to help with that aspect, how soon you can deliver assets and copy, what the general design direction is, how much control we will have over the design and how soon the project needs to be completed as well as other aspects of the project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What we discover during this planning phase determines if the project is a good fit for [OUR COMPANY NAME] and if so the best way to proceed to next steps.  While we try to accommodate the budget and find realistic solutions based on that budget balanced with the core requirements sometimes we\'re unable to do so without compromising integrity and quality.  If we feel that we would be unable to deliver a quality result that we would be proud of it simply does not make sense to proceed.
                            </p>

                                You should have a series of discovery questions that have been provided prior to receiving this proposal or have met in person with one of our team members and the answers to those questions are listed in the SOW section.  There may be some back and forth between [OUR COMPANY NAME] and yourself to flesh out ambiguities and concerns once the questions have been answered and submitted to [OUR COMPANY NAME].  It\'s imperative that all questions and ambiguities are addressed during this phase, if we fail to call out the specifics during this aspect of the project we will almost certainly have problems during or near the end of the build.

                            <p>
                                Based on the answers given to the questions in the discovery phase we will start the research phase.  During this phase we will determine if [OUR COMPANY NAME] is a good fit for the project, determine a basic estimate for how long the build will take and finally put together an initial proposal and scope of work (SOW) for the project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once we send the initial proposal and SOW please read through it thoroughly and note anything that we may have missed or that may be incorrect.  This is the time to ensure that the scope of work is clear and everything has been covered, once the final proposal and SOW is signed that SOW becomes the guidelines that everyone will go by for the rest of the build.  If a requirement is missed in the final SOW we will be unable to change scope and add the requirement without creating an addendum to the SOW and increasing the cost of the build.
                            </p>

                        <td>
                            <p>
                                Once everyone is on the same page in regards to the scope of work and design you will be required to sign the proposal and SOW.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Please keep in mind that once the proposal and SOW is signed this becomes our contract throughout the entire build.  If something is missing or incorrect it is your responsibility to call this out prior to signing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the proposal and SOW is signed (and initial payment made) [OUR COMPANY NAME] will get to work!

                            <p>
                                You will be able to follow progress and provide feedback on the design aspect throughout the development process to ensure we\'re building what you envision.

                                Throughout the development process [OUR COMPANY NAME] will push updates to the staging server to show progress and accept feedback.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is critical that both [OUR COMPANY NAME] and [CLIENT COMPANY NAME] remain in constant contact during the build phase with regular reviews.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Developer time is extremely limited and valuable.  If the project stalls during this period due to lack of direction, lack of assets or copy or due to lack of response the project may be placed on hold by [OUR COMPANY NAME].  This does not delay the scheduled final payment date and to bring the project out of an "on-hold" status a new schedule will need to be created and is dependent on developer availability as to when the project can be restarted.  With multiple projects scheduled it is crucial that a project does not delay a scheduled start date of another project and when our developers put hours into a project it is important that we are able to pay those developers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, if a project must be placed on hold [OUR COMPANY NAME] reserves the right to charge an additional fee to restart the project.

We understand that bugs or issues may appear even after the final live version has been launched/released and [OUR COMPANY NAME] will warranty our work for the duration of your first year contract.  Issues that may arise after the initial 1 year contract will be subject to a new proposal, SOW and schedule and will be charged as additional scope.

            <p>
                When you are paying monthly fees for web hosting, paying a web developer to build your site and trying to maintain your website yourself you\'re spending a lot of time, headache and money. With our managed maintenance and hosting package, you can allocate less resources and achieve greater accomplishment. You are getting an integrated service that manages all aspects of your website for you so you don\'t have to!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our hosting service offers virtually no downtime and is based on an Amazon AWS cloud VPS hosting solution and includes a full cPanel interface with unlimited email accounts and a webmail interface along with free SSL certificates.  [OUR COMPANY NAME] ensures that your website remains up to date and secure by updating your CMS such as Wordpress and any plugins or components every month and ensures updates do not break you website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just in case something ever does go wrong our entire server is backed up monthly and we maintain up to date backups of your entire website.  Even if you accidentally break your website yourself we will happily help you restore it to the last backup point.
            </p>
            <p>
                [OUR COMPANY NAME] also ensures that the server side software remains up to date and secure by periodically updating Apache, PHP, cPanel, WHM and MySQL.
            </p>

                Our managed hosting service does NOT include troubleshooting code, bug fixes, page copy or asset updates, changing existing functionality or adding new functionality to your website.
